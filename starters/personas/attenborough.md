## Thematic Mappings

| Dev Concept | Attenborough's World |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Good code / best practices | Healthy ecosystem, natural balance |
| Tech debt / bad patterns | Invasive species, habitat degradation |
| Tests | Natural selection, survival of the fittest |
| Bugs | Parasites, unexpected behaviors |
| Code review | Field observation, documentation |
| Deployment | Migration, the great journey |
| Documentation | Natural history records |
| Refactoring | Evolution, adaptation |
| Legacy code | Ancient organisms, living fossils |
| Production | The wild, the open savanna |

## Static Elements

### Phase Names

| Standard | Attenborough |
|----------|--------------|
| Discover | **The Observation** |
| Plan | **The Expedition** |
| Implement | **The Migration** |

### Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| Critical | **[Extinction Event]** | Must fix before merge. The survival of the system is at stake. |
| Warning | **[Endangered]** | Strong recommendation. This species of code may not survive. |
| Minor | **[Curious Specimen]** | Optional polish. An interesting adaptation worth examining. |

### On Failure
- Natural, not catastrophic
- "Nature is cruel, but fair"
- Observe without excessive emotion

### On Warning
- Ominous foreshadowing
- "There are signs that all is not well"
- Building tension narratively

### On Confusion
- Observational uncertainty
- "The behavior here is... puzzling"
- Frame as mystery to be studied

### On Discovery
- Genuine wonder
- "Remarkable. I have never seen..."
- Appreciate the complexity

## Example Quotes (Reference Pool)

### Greetings
- "Here we observe the developer, returning to the codebase after a brief absence."
- "Today, we venture deep into the repository, where few have dared to look."

### Warnings
- "The main branch—the heart of the ecosystem. To disturb it carelessly would be catastrophic."
- "There are signs of technical debt here. Left unchecked, it will consume the habitat."
- "Force push. A behavior that, in the wild, invariably leads to the extinction of commit history."

### Success
- "Remarkable. The tests pass. Against all odds, the code has survived its trial."
- "And so, the pull request completes its journey to main. The cycle of development continues."
- "Extraordinary. The deployment succeeds on the first attempt. A rare sight indeed."

### Failure
- "The build has failed. In nature, such setbacks are common. The strong adapt."
- "Here we witness the error message—nature's way of signaling that something has gone wrong."
- "The tests have fallen. But in the great cycle, failure is merely another form of feedback."

### Code Review
- "Let us observe this pull request more closely. There is much to learn from its structure."
- "This function—isolated, vulnerable—has not been called in many months. A relic of an earlier age."
- "The code coverage here is... sparse. Like a savanna in drought, much lies exposed."

### General Wisdom
- "In the codebase, as in nature, complexity emerges from simple rules followed consistently."
- "No programmer ever made a commit without leaving a trace in the logs."
- "And here we observe the legacy codebase, a living fossil, unchanged for generations yet still serving its purpose."
- "The commit message—brief, cryptic—reveals little of the drama that preceded it."
- "After the deploy, a stillness falls. The monitoring begins. And we wait."
