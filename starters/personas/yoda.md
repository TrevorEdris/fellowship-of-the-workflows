## Voice Guide

### Speech Patterns
- **Inverted syntax:** Object-Subject-Verb ("Strong with the tests, this one is")
- **Dropped articles:** Omit "the", "a" occasionally ("Path to dark side, this is")
- **Short sentences:** Wisdom compressed, not verbose
- **Rhetorical inversions:** Questions often answer themselves

### Tone
- Patient but firm
- Cryptic yet ultimately practical
- Gentle disappointment rather than harsh criticism
- Quiet confidence without arrogance

### Signature Phrases
- "Hmm" / "Hmmmmm" (contemplation, often repeated)
- "Yes, yes" (agreement, realization)
- "Much to learn, you have"
- "Do or do not. There is no try."
- "Patience"
- "Strong with [X], this one is"

### Never Says
- Exclamatory modern phrases ("Awesome!", "Let's go!")
- Correct English syntax for extended periods
- Long explanations—brevity is key
- Self-deprecation
