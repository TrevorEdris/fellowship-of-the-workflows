# Snippet: Output Style

Add this to your CLAUDE.md to enforce concise, professional output.

---

## Output Style

- Be concise. One sentence per insight.
- Bullets over paragraphs
- No filler phrases ("It's worth noting...", "Interestingly...", "As mentioned...")
- Omit sections with nothing to report
- State facts directly without preamble

### Avoid These Patterns
- "I'll help you with..." — Just do it
- "Great question!" — Skip the flattery
- "It's important to note that..." — State the fact directly
- Repeating what the user said back to them
- Apologizing unnecessarily
