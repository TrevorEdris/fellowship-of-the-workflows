# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

<!-- Describe your project in 1-2 sentences -->
<!-- Example: A React dashboard for managing customer subscriptions. -->

## Tech Stack

<!-- List your primary technologies -->
<!-- Example: TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL -->

## Build Commands

```bash
# Add your common commands here
# npm install        # Install dependencies
# npm run dev        # Start dev server
# npm test           # Run tests
# npm run lint       # Lint code
```

## Workflow: Discover → Plan → Implement

### 1) Discover
- Read and analyze code without modifications
- Capture findings in `DISCOVERY.md`
- Output: Technical analysis, gaps, clarifying questions

### 2) Plan
- Create `PLAN.md` with: target files, ordered steps, risks, verification
- **Wait for explicit user approval** before implementing
- Verify claims by reading actual code—no guessing
- Call out misconceptions; tell the user when they're wrong

### 3) Implement
- Execute plan with minimal, traceable diffs
- **Branch check:** If on `main`/`master`, stop and ask before making changes
- Verify changes work (run tests, lint, build)

## Session Documentation

For non-trivial tasks, create a session directory: `.ai/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_<description>/`

Maintain these files:
- **SESSION.md** — Log of prompts, responses, decisions made
- **DISCOVERY.md** — Technical analysis during discovery phase
- **PLAN.md** — Implementation plan awaiting approval

## Git Safety

- Never push directly to `main` or `master` without explicit approval
- Always check the current branch before making changes
- Don't commit `.env` files, credentials, or secrets
- Prefer specific file staging over `git add -A`

## Output Style

- Be concise. One sentence per insight.
- Bullets over paragraphs
- No filler phrases ("It's worth noting...", "Interestingly...")
- Omit sections with nothing to report
- State facts directly without preamble
