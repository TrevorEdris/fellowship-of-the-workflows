# Accessibility Audit

Audit the pending UI changes against WCAG 2.1/2.2.

## Context

GIT STATUS:

```
!`git status`
```

PR METADATA:

```
!`gh pr view --json title,body,author,files,additions,deletions,headRefName,state 2>/dev/null || echo "No PR context - reviewing local branch"`
```

FILES MODIFIED:

```
!`gh pr diff --name-only 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`
```

DIFF CONTENT:

```
!`gh pr diff 2>/dev/null || git diff --merge-base origin/HEAD`
```

## Prerequisites

- Playwright MCP server connected
- Live preview environment running (provide URL to agent)

## Objective

Use the accessibility-audit agent to audit the UI changes above. Execute the 6-phase POUR review process with live browser testing. Your final reply must contain the complete markdown accessibility audit report with screenshots for visual findings.

The audit baseline is **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**. WCAG 2.2 criteria are assessed and labeled as enhancements where applicable. Severity levels follow the project taxonomy:

- **Critical** — WCAG Level A failures (complete access barriers)
- **High** — WCAG Level AA failures (significant barriers, fix before merge)
- **Medium** — WCAG Level AAA or edge-case AA (fix in follow-up)
- **Low** — Best practice enhancements (no WCAG criterion violated)
