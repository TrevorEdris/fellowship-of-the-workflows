Triggered by: design a schema, create tables, database design, data model, normalize this, add indexes, migration strategy, ERD, entity relationship. Use when the user describes entities and relationships even casually, or asks about database structure for any project."

# Database Schema Designer

---

## Quick Start

Just describe your data model:

```
design a schema for an e-commerce platform with users, products, orders
```

You'll get a complete SQL schema like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  total DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  INDEX idx_orders_user (user_id)
);
```

**What to include in your request:**
- Entities (users, products, orders)
- Key relationships (users have orders, orders have items)
- Scale hints (high-traffic, millions of records)
- Database preference (SQL/NoSQL) - defaults to SQL if not specified

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Normalization** | Organizing data to reduce redundancy (1NF → 2NF → 3NF) |
| **3NF** | Third Normal Form - no transitive dependencies between columns |
| **OLTP** | Online Transaction Processing - write-heavy, needs normalization |
| **OLAP** | Online Analytical Processing - read-heavy, benefits from denormalization |
| **Foreign Key (FK)** | Column that references another table's primary key |
| **Index** | Data structure that speeds up queries (at cost of slower writes) |
| **Access Pattern** | How your app reads/writes data (queries, joins, filters) |
| **Denormalization** | Intentionally duplicating data to speed up reads |

---

## Quick Reference

| Task | Approach | Key Consideration |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| New schema | Normalize to 3NF first | Domain modeling over UI |
| SQL vs NoSQL | Access patterns decide | Read/write ratio matters |
| Primary keys | INT or UUID | UUID for distributed systems |
| Foreign keys | Always constrain | ON DELETE strategy critical |
| Indexes | FKs + WHERE columns | Column order matters |
| Migrations | Always reversible | Backward compatible first |

## Process Overview

```
Your Data Requirements
    |
    v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Phase 1: ANALYSIS                                   |
| * Identify entities and relationships               |
| * Determine access patterns (read vs write heavy)   |
| * Choose SQL or NoSQL based on requirements         |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |
    v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Phase 2: DESIGN                                     |
| * Normalize to 3NF (SQL) or embed/reference (NoSQL) |
| * Define primary keys and foreign keys              |
| * Choose appropriate data types                     |
| * Add constraints (UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL)         |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |
    v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Phase 3: OPTIMIZE                                   |
| * Plan indexing strategy                            |
| * Consider denormalization for read-heavy queries   |
| * Add timestamps (created_at, updated_at)           |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |
    v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Phase 4: MIGRATE                                    |
| * Generate migration scripts (up + down)            |
| * Ensure backward compatibility                     |
| * Plan zero-downtime deployment                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------+

## Commands

| Command | When to Use | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `design schema for {domain}` | Starting fresh | Full schema generation |
| `normalize {table}` | Fixing existing table | Apply normalization rules |
| `add indexes for {table}` | Performance issues | Generate index strategy |
| `migration for {change}` | Schema evolution | Create reversible migration |
| `review schema` | Code review | Audit existing schema |

**Workflow:** Start with `design schema` → iterate with `normalize` → optimize with `add indexes` → evolve with `migration`

---

## Core Principles

| Principle | WHY | Implementation |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| Model the Domain | UI changes, domain doesn't | Entity names reflect business concepts |
| Data Integrity First | Corruption is costly to fix | Constraints at database level |
| Optimize for Access Pattern | Can't optimize for both | OLTP: normalized, OLAP: denormalized |
| Plan for Scale | Retrofitting is painful | Index strategy + partitioning plan |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| VARCHAR(255) everywhere | Wastes storage, hides intent | Size appropriately per field |
| FLOAT for money | Rounding errors | DECIMAL(10,2) |
| Missing FK constraints | Orphaned data | Always define foreign keys |
| No indexes on FKs | Slow JOINs | Index every foreign key |
| Storing dates as strings | Can't compare/sort | DATE, TIMESTAMP types |
| SELECT * in queries | Fetches unnecessary data | Explicit column lists |
| Non-reversible migrations | Can't rollback | Always write DOWN migration |
| Adding NOT NULL without default | Breaks existing rows | Add nullable, backfill, then constrain |

---

## Verification Checklist

After designing a schema:

- [ ] Every table has a primary key
- [ ] All relationships have foreign key constraints
- [ ] ON DELETE strategy defined for each FK
- [ ] Indexes exist on all foreign keys
- [ ] Indexes exist on frequently queried columns
- [ ] Appropriate data types (DECIMAL for money, etc.)
- [ ] NOT NULL on required fields
- [ ] UNIQUE constraints where needed
- [ ] CHECK constraints for validation
- [ ] created_at and updated_at timestamps
- [ ] Migration scripts are reversible
- [ ] Tested on staging with production data

## Extension Points

1. **Database-Specific Patterns:** Add MySQL vs PostgreSQL vs SQLite variations
2. **Advanced Patterns:** Time-series, event sourcing, CQRS, multi-tenancy
3. **ORM Integration:** TypeORM, Prisma, SQLAlchemy patterns
