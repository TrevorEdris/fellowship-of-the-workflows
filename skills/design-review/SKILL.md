# Design Review

Review the pending front-end changes for design quality.

## Context

GIT STATUS:

```
!`git status 2>/dev/null || echo "(not a git repository — no local changes to show)"`
```

PR METADATA:

```
!`gh pr view --json title,body,author,files,additions,deletions,headRefName,state 2>/dev/null || echo "No PR context - reviewing local branch"`
```

FILES MODIFIED:

```
!`gh pr diff --name-only 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`
```

DIFF CONTENT:

```
!`gh pr diff 2>/dev/null || git diff --merge-base origin/HEAD`
```

## Prerequisites

- Playwright MCP server connected
- Live preview environment running (provide URL to agent)

## Objective

Use the design-review agent to review the UI/UX changes above. Execute the 8-phase review process (including AI slop check) with live browser testing. Your final reply must contain the markdown report with screenshots.

## Extending with Impeccable

For finer-grained design commands (audit, normalize, polish, bolder, harden, and 15 more), consider installing the [impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) plugin alongside FOTW. Impeccable provides actionable design steering commands and a persistent project design context file (`.impeccable.md`).
