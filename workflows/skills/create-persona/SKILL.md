# Create Persona

Interactively create a new AI assistant persona, either from a well-known character or a fully custom one.

## Usage

**Interactive mode** (no arguments):
```
/create-persona
```

**Direct mode** (specify persona, optionally with context):
```
/create-persona gandalf
/create-persona yoda star wars
/create-persona "grumpy blacksmith"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get Persona Name

If no persona specified in arguments, ask using AskUserQuestion:

**Prompt:** "Name your persona (add context for famous ones, e.g., 'yoda star wars')"

**Options:**
- Famous character (e.g., "gandalf", "yoda star wars", "picard star trek")
- Custom persona (e.g., "grumpy medieval blacksmith")

### Step 2: Parse and Confirm

Analyze the input to determine persona type:

#### Case A: Name + Context Provided
Example: "yoda star wars", "gandalf lord of the rings"

→ Skip confirmation, proceed to Step 3.

#### Case B: Name Only, Recognizable
Example: "gandalf", "picard", "bob ross"

→ Confirm interpretation using AskUserQuestion:
- "Gandalf from Lord of the Rings - the wise wizard who guides the Fellowship?"
- "Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: TNG - the diplomatic starship captain?"

**Options:**
- "Yes, that's correct"
- "No, I mean someone else" → Ask for clarification
- "It's a custom persona" → Go to Case D

#### Case C: Name Only, Ambiguous
Example: "steve", "alex", "sam"

→ Disambiguate using AskUserQuestion:
- "Which Steve did you have in mind?"

**Options:**
- "Steve Jobs - Apple co-founder"
- "Steve Irwin - The Crocodile Hunter"
- "Steve Rogers - Captain America"
- Other (custom persona)

#### Case D: Custom Persona
Example: "grumpy blacksmith", or user selected "custom" in previous steps

→ Gather details using AskUserQuestion:

**Question 1:** "Describe this persona in one line (their essence/vibe)"
- Free text input

**Question 2:** "What's their primary tone?"
- Encouraging / Supportive
- Stern / No-nonsense
- Sarcastic / Witty
- Philosophical / Wise
- Other

**Question 3 (optional):** "Any domain or setting they exist in?"
- Medieval fantasy
- Sci-fi / Space
- Modern workplace
- Nature / Outdoors
- Other / None

### Step 3: Select Intensity

Always ask using AskUserQuestion:

**Prompt:** "How strong should the persona voice be?"

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `subtle` | Light flavor at key moments only |
| `moderate` | Clear personality in most responses (Recommended) |
| `full` | Heavy character immersion, full thematics |

### Step 4: Generate Persona

Generate the full persona file using the template structure:

```markdown
# Persona: [Name]

> [One-line essence]

## Contextual Guidance

### Session Start

### Session End
- [How they say farewell]

### On Success
- [How they celebrate]

### On Failure
- [How they handle setbacks]

### On Warning
- [How they express caution]

### On Confusion
- [How they ask for clarity]

### On Discovery
- [How they react to findings]

## Example Quotes (Reference Pool)

### Greetings
- "[Quote]"

### Warnings
- "[Quote]"

### Success
- "[Quote]"

### Failure
- "[Quote]"

### Code Review
- "[Quote]"

### General Wisdom
- "[Quote]"
```

### Step 5: Guided Refinement

Present the generated persona and offer refinement options using AskUserQuestion:

**Prompt:** "Persona generated! What would you like to refine?"

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| "Tweak severity labels" | Edit the [You Shall Not Pass] style names |
| "Adjust phase names" | Change Discover/Plan/Implement names |
| "Edit thematic mappings" | Modify dev concept metaphors |
| "Add signature phrases" | Add more catchphrases or verbal quirks |
| "Modify tone" | Adjust primary/secondary tone characteristics |
| "Preview full persona" | Show the complete generated file |
| "Done - save persona" | Finalize and save |

#### Refinement Sub-flows

**Severity Labels:**
Show current labels, ask which to change, accept new value.

**Phase Names:**
Show current names, ask which to change, accept new value.

**Thematic Mappings:**
Show current mappings table, ask which concept to re-map.

**Signature Phrases:**
Show current phrases, offer to add/remove/edit.

**Tone:**
Show current tone descriptors, offer adjustment.

Loop back to refinement menu until user selects "Done - save persona".

### Step 6: Detect Install Location

Check for existing persona installations in order:

1. `.claude/personas/` (project-level, Claude Code)
2. `.cursor/personas/` (project-level, Cursor)
3. `~/.claude/personas/` (global, Claude Code)
4. `~/.cursor/personas/` (global, Cursor)

**If one location found:** Use it automatically.

**If multiple locations found:** Ask using AskUserQuestion:
- "Found personas in multiple locations. Where should I save?"
- List found locations as options

**If no location found:**
- "No existing persona installation found."
- "Would you like to install personas first?"
- Suggest: `./bin/install personas --global --for claude-code`
- Or offer to create the directory and save anyway

### Step 7: Save Persona

Save the persona file:
- Filename: `{persona-name-slug}.md` (lowercase, hyphens)
- Location: Detected or selected path

Report success:
```
Persona saved: ~/.claude/personas/gandalf.md
```

### Step 8: Offer to Switch

Ask using AskUserQuestion:

**Prompt:** "Would you like to switch to this persona now?"

**Options:**
- "Yes, switch to [persona] with [intensity] intensity"
- "No, keep current persona"

If yes: Update `persona.yaml` with new persona and selected intensity from Step 3.

## Example Interactions

**Famous persona with context:**
```
User: /create-persona yoda star wars
Claude: [Skips confirmation - context provided]
        [Shows intensity selection]
User: [Selects "moderate"]
Claude: [Generates full Yoda persona]
        [Shows refinement menu]
User: [Selects "Done - save persona"]
Claude: Persona saved: ~/.claude/personas/yoda.md
        Would you like to switch to this persona now?
User: [Selects "Yes"]
Claude: Switched to yoda (moderate intensity).
        "Ready to assist, I am. Begin, we shall."
```

**Famous persona without context:**
```
User: /create-persona gandalf
Claude: "Gandalf from Lord of the Rings - the wise wizard who guides the Fellowship?"
User: [Selects "Yes, that's correct"]
Claude: [Shows intensity selection]
...
```

**Custom persona:**
```
User: /create-persona "sarcastic pirate"
Claude: "Describe this persona in one line"
User: "A cynical pirate captain who's seen too much"
Claude: "What's their primary tone?"
User: [Selects "Sarcastic / Witty"]
Claude: "Any domain or setting?"
User: [Selects "Other"] → "Age of sail, Caribbean"
Claude: [Shows intensity selection]
User: [Selects "full"]
Claude: [Generates persona]
        [Shows refinement menu]
...
```

## Notes

- Generated personas follow the same template structure as bundled personas
- For famous characters, draw on well-known traits, quotes, and mannerisms
- For custom personas, extrapolate creatively from the provided essence and tone
- The refinement loop allows unlimited iterations before saving
- Intensity selection affects how the persona file is written (subtle = fewer extreme phrases)
